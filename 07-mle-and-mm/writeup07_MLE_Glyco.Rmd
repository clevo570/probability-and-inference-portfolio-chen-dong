# Introduction

Maximum likelihood (MLE) and method of moments (MM) are two common methods for constructing a model.

# Background

I will explain to the reader how one might use MLE and MM to model (a) Glycohemoglobin and (b) Height of adult females. The data will be from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009-2010 (NHANES), available from the Hmisc package. I will compare and contrast the two methods in addition to comparing and contrasting the choice of underlying distribution.

## Data

```{r}
#Import data
require(dplyr)
Hmisc::getHdata(nhgh)
d1 <- nhgh %>% 
  filter(sex == "female") %>% 
  filter(age >= 18) %>% 
  select(gh, ht) %>% 
  filter(1:n()<=1000)
```

## Normal Distribution

### Estimates of parameters

```{r}
#HT,Normal, MLE
ll <- function(params, data)  sum(dnorm(data,params[1],params[2],log=TRUE))
#ll(c(2,3),d1$gh)
g <- function(x) {
  out <- x
  for(i in seq_along(x)){
    out[i] <- ll(c(x[i],1),d1$gh)
  }
  out
}

h <- function(x) {
  out <- x
  for(i in seq_along(x)){
    out[i] <- ll(c(5.7,x[i]),d1$gh)
  }
  out
}
```

In this chunk, we build function f and function g. These functions are used to calculte the other parameter when fix one. Using the principle of MLE. They help us adjust the parameters.

```{r}
require(stats4)
nLL <- function(mean, sd){
  fs <- dnorm(
        x = d1$gh
      , mean = mean
      , sd = sd
      , log = TRUE
    ) 
  -sum(fs)
}
param_hat <- mle(
    nLL
  , start = list(mean = 5.7, sd = 1)
  , method = "L-BFGS-B"
  , lower = c(0, 0.01)
)

par(mfrow = c(1,2)); plot(profile(param_hat), absVal = FALSE)

```

In this chunk, we use function to calculate the MLE when set two parameters that close to real MLE. From the figure, we can see when z=0, the two parameters are what we need.

```{r}
coef(param_hat)
```

This is the specific value of the two parameters.

### Overlay estimated pdf onto histogram	

```{r}
hist(d1$gh,breaks = 100, freq = FALSE)
curve(dnorm(x,mean=coef(param_hat)[1],sd=coef(param_hat)[2]),col="red",lwd=6,add=T)
```

The figure above is that overlay estimated pdf onto histogram of the empirical distribution. It can be seen that their distribution is very concentrated in the 4-8 interval.

### Overlay estimated CDF onto eCDF	

```{r}
plot(ecdf(d1$gh))
curve(pnorm(x,mean=coef(param_hat)[1],sd=coef(param_hat)[2]),col="red",lwd=6,add=T)
```

The figure above is that overlay estimated CDF onto eCDF of the empirical distribution. The figure does not fit well, at least not as good as the height. It may be because the distribution is too concentrated. Small disturbances have big consequences.

### QQ plot (sample vs estimated dist)

```{r}
qs <- seq(0.05,0.95,length=50)
sample_qs <- quantile(d1$gh,qs)
theor_qs <- qnorm(qs,mean=coef(param_hat)[1],sd=coef(param_hat)[2])
plot(sample_qs,theor_qs,pch=16)
abline(0,1)
```

Sample max doesn't fit a straight line with y=x perfectly. We cannot say that the sample quantile fits the theoretical quantile very well.

### Estimated Median

```{r}
qnorm(0.5,mean=coef(param_hat)[1],sd=coef(param_hat)[2])
```

The estimated Median is `r qnorm(0.5,mean=coef(param_hat)[1],sd=coef(param_hat)[2])`. We use `qnorm` to select 50% of the observations, 50% of the observations are less than it, and 50% of the observations are greater than it. So this is the median of the sample.

### Median Samp Dist (hist)

```{r}
M <- 5000
N <- 1000
out <- rnorm(M*N,mean=coef(param_hat)[1],sd=coef(param_hat)[2]) %>% array( dim=c(M,N))
sample_dist <- apply(out,1,median)
hist(sample_dist, breaks = 100)
```

The figure above is that median Samp Dist (hist). We simulated 5000 experiments, each with 1000 observations, so we take the median of these 5000 experiments. Draw as histogram.

### Range of middle 95% of Samp Dist

```{r}
#hist(sample_dist, breaks = 100)
quantile(sample_dist,c(0.05/2, 1 - 0.05/2))
#abline(v = quantile(sample_dist,c(0.05/2, 1 - 0.05/2)), col = "blue", lty = 2)
```

The  Range of middle 95% of Samp Dist is from `r quantile(sample_dist,c(0.05/2, 1 - 0.05/2))[1]` to `r quantile(sample_dist,c(0.05/2, 1 - 0.05/2))[2]`. This is the 95% confidence interval. We have 95% confidence that median will be within this range. This has an indicator effect on statistical inference.




## Gamma

### Estimates of parameters

```{r}
#HT,Gamma, MLE
ll <- function(params, data)  sum(dgamma(data,params[1],params[2],log=TRUE))
#ll(c(2,3),d1$gh)
g <- function(x) {
  out <- x
  for(i in seq_along(x)){
    out[i] <- ll(c(x[i],0.14),d1$gh)
  }
  out
}

h <- function(x) {
  out <- x
  for(i in seq_along(x)){
    out[i] <- ll(c(40,x[i]),d1$gh)
  }
  out
}
```

In this chunk, we build function f and function g. These functions are used to calculte the other parameter when fix one. Using the principle of MLE. They help us adjust the parameters.

```{r}
require(stats4)
nLL_gamma <- function(shape, scale){
  fs <- dgamma(
        x = d1$gh
      , shape = shape
      , scale = scale
      , log = TRUE
    ) 
  -sum(fs)
}
param_hat_gamma <- mle(
    nLL_gamma
  , start = list(shape = 40, scale = 0.14)
  , method = "L-BFGS-B"
  , lower = c(0, 0.01)
)

par(mfrow = c(1,2)); plot(profile(param_hat_gamma), absVal = FALSE)

```

In this chunk, we use function to calculate the MLE when set two parameters that close to real MLE. From the figure, we can see when z=0, the two parameters are what we need.

```{r}
coef(param_hat_gamma)
```

This is the specific value of the two parameters.

### Overlay estimated pdf onto histogram	

```{r}
hist(d1$gh,breaks = 100, freq = FALSE)
curve(dgamma(x,shape=coef(param_hat_gamma)[1],scale=coef(param_hat_gamma)[2]),col="red",lwd=6,add=T)
```

The figure above is that overlay estimated pdf onto histogram of the empirical distribution. It can be seen that their distribution is very concentrated in the 4-8 interval.

### Overlay estimated CDF onto eCDF	

```{r}
plot(ecdf(d1$gh))
curve(pgamma(x,shape=coef(param_hat_gamma)[1],scale=coef(param_hat_gamma)[2]),col="red",lwd=6,add=T)
```

The figure above is that overlay estimated CDF onto eCDF of the empirical distribution. The figure does not fit well, at least not as good as the height. It may be because the distribution is too concentrated. Small disturbances have big consequences.

### QQ plot (sample vs estimated dist)

```{r}
qs <- seq(0.05,0.95,length=50)
sample_qs <- quantile(d1$gh,qs)
theor_qs <- qgamma(qs,shape=coef(param_hat_gamma)[1],scale=coef(param_hat_gamma)[2])
plot(sample_qs,theor_qs,pch=16)
abline(0,1)
```

Sample max doesn't fit a straight line with y=x perfectly. We cannot say that the sample quantile fits the theoretical quantile very well.

### Estimated Median

```{r}
qgamma(0.5,shape=coef(param_hat_gamma)[1],scale=coef(param_hat_gamma)[2])
```

The estimated Median is `r qgamma(0.5,shape=coef(param_hat_gamma)[1],scale=coef(param_hat_gamma)[2])`. We use `qgamma` to select 50% of the observations, 50% of the observations are less than it, and 50% of the observations are greater than it. So this is the median of the sample.

### Median Samp Dist (hist)

```{r}
M <- 5000
N <- 1000
out <- rgamma(M*N,shape=coef(param_hat_gamma)[1],scale=coef(param_hat_gamma)[2]) %>% array( dim=c(M,N))
sample_dist <- apply(out,1,median)
hist(sample_dist, breaks = 100)
```

The figure above is that median Samp Dist (hist). We simulated 5000 experiments, each with 1000 observations, so we take the median of these 5000 experiments. Draw as histogram.

### Range of middle 95% of Samp Dist

```{r}
quantile(sample_dist,c(0.05/2, 1 - 0.05/2))
```

The  Range of middle 95% of Samp Dist is from `r quantile(sample_dist,c(0.05/2, 1 - 0.05/2))[1]` to `r quantile(sample_dist,c(0.05/2, 1 - 0.05/2))[2]`. This is the 95% confidence interval. We have 95% confidence that median will be within this range. This has an indicator effect on statistical inference.




## Weibull

### Estimates of parameters

```{r}
#HT,Gamma, MLE
ll <- function(params, data)  sum(dweibull(data,params[1],params[2],log=TRUE))
#ll(c(2,3),d1$gh)
g <- function(x) {
  out <- x
  for(i in seq_along(x)){
    out[i] <- ll(c(x[i],6.2),d1$gh)
  }
  out
}

h <- function(x) {
  out <- x
  for(i in seq_along(x)){
    out[i] <- ll(c(4.1,x[i]),d1$gh)
  }
  out
}
```

In this chunk, we build function f and function g. These functions are used to calculte the other parameter when fix one. Using the principle of MLE. They help us adjust the parameters.

```{r}
require(stats4)
nLL_weibull <- function(shape, scale){
  fs <- dweibull(
        x = d1$gh
      , shape = shape
      , scale = scale
      , log = TRUE
    ) 
  -sum(fs)
}
param_hat_weibull <- mle(
    nLL_weibull
  , start = list(shape = 4.1, scale = 6.2)
  , method = "L-BFGS-B"
  , lower = c(0, 0.01)
)

par(mfrow = c(1,2)); plot(profile(param_hat_weibull), absVal = FALSE)

```

```{r}
coef(param_hat_weibull)
```

This is the specific value of the two parameters.

### Overlay estimated pdf onto histogram	

```{r}
hist(d1$gh,breaks = 100, freq = FALSE)
curve(dweibull(x,shape=coef(param_hat_weibull)[1],scale=coef(param_hat_weibull)[2]),col="red",lwd=6,add=T)
```

The figure above is that overlay estimated pdf onto histogram of the empirical distribution. It can be seen that their distribution is very concentrated in the 4-8 interval.

### Overlay estimated CDF onto eCDF	

```{r}
plot(ecdf(d1$gh))
curve(pweibull(x,shape=coef(param_hat_weibull)[1],scale=coef(param_hat_weibull)[2]),col="red",lwd=6,add=T)
```

The figure above is that overlay estimated CDF onto eCDF of the empirical distribution. The figure does not fit well, at least not as good as the height. It may be because the distribution is too concentrated. Small disturbances have big consequences.

### QQ plot (sample vs estimated dist)

```{r}
qs <- seq(0.05,0.95,length=50)
sample_qs <- quantile(d1$gh,qs)
theor_qs <- qweibull(qs,shape=coef(param_hat_weibull)[1],scale=coef(param_hat_weibull)[2])
plot(sample_qs,theor_qs,pch=16)
abline(0,1)
```

Sample max doesn't fit a straight line with y=x perfectly. We cannot say that the sample quantile fits the theoretical quantile very well.

### Estimated Median

```{r}
qweibull(0.5,shape=coef(param_hat_weibull)[1],scale=coef(param_hat_weibull)[2])
```

The estimated Median is `r qweibull(0.5,shape=coef(param_hat_weibull)[1],scale=coef(param_hat_weibull)[2])`. We use `qweibull` to select 50% of the observations, 50% of the observations are less than it, and 50% of the observations are greater than it. So this is the median of the sample.

### Median Samp Dist (hist)

```{r}
M <- 5000
N <- 1000
out <- rweibull(M*N,shape=coef(param_hat_weibull)[1],scale=coef(param_hat_weibull)[2]) %>% array( dim=c(M,N))
sample_dist <- apply(out,1,median)
hist(sample_dist, breaks = 100)
```

The figure above is that median Samp Dist (hist). We simulated 5000 experiments, each with 1000 observations, so we take the median of these 5000 experiments. Draw as histogram.

We have 95% confidence that median will be within this range. This has an indicator effect on statistical inference.
