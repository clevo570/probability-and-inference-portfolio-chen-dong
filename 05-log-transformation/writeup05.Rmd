# Introduction
It is common in the analysis of biological data to log transform data representing concentrations or data representing dose response. Here we are going to perform logarithmic transformation and explore the problem.


# Method

Part 1
------

-   For each distribution below, generate a figure of the PDF and CDF.
    Mark the mean and median in the figure.

-   For each distribution below, generate a figure of the PDF and CDF of
    the transformation Y = log(X) random variable. Mark the mean and
    median in the figure. You may use simulation or analytic methods in
    order find the PDF and CDF of the transformation.

-   For each of the distributions below, generate 1000 samples of
    size 100. For each sample, calculate the geometric and arithmetic
    mean. Generate a scatter plot of the geometic and arithmetic sample
    means. Add the line of identify as a reference line.

-   Generate a histogram of the difference between the arithmetic mean
    and the geometric mean.

Part 2
------

Show that if *X*<sub>*i*</sub> \> 0 for all *i*, then the arithmetic
mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean.

Hint: Start with the sample mean of the transformation
*Y*<sub>*i*</sub> = log (*X*<sub>*i*</sub>).
